**CD1a-single-cell**
CD1a presents a range of self-lipid antigens found within the skin. Here in this study, we leveraged the power and potential of Plate-based single-cell RNAseq method to explore and analyze the expanded T-cell against the CD1a displayed ligands. We also confirmed the findings via Bulk RNAseq method (Manuscript Accepted).
